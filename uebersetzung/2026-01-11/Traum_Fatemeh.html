    Dear Pastor Georg,

Yesterday, after work, I was very exhausted and tired, so I just prayed and went to sleep. 

Last night, I had a very intense dream that I would like to describe. In it, four natural disasters occurred in quick succession.

First, an extremely strong wind came up, comparable to a violent tornado. The wind accelerated, shook, and swept away everything outside. At that moment, I was in a church. Nothing happened inside the church. All the people there were protected and did not notice what was happening outside. Nothing happened to me either. I watched the events from a distance through a window of our church.

Immediately afterwards, a large tsunami followed outside, sweeping everything away and destroying it. This event was also not noticed inside the church. I could still only see it from inside through the window.

Then avalanches formed outside, some of them burning, rolling across the streets. Many people were caught up in them. They screamed, were injured, and bled profusely. Among them were women who held their small babies protectively in their arms. Some people burned and bled to death.

Without any transition, the avalanches turned cold, everything came to a standstill, dried up, and froze. At that moment, I turned around and shouted loudly that a water shortage and drought were coming. I immediately went upstairs to collect water and filled water jugs and pots. Despite my shouting, the other people did not hear me.

After I had collected enough water, I returned to the window in the community. There I saw that the entire earth and the streets were covered with clear water—very pure, turquoise, and almost paradisiacal. Then complete silence fell, and I woke up from the dream.

After I told Farshid about this dream, he told me that I should pass this dream on to you.

We wish you a blessed time!

Kind regards, 
Fatemeh
