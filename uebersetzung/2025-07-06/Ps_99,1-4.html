    1 The Lord reigns, let the nations tremble; he sits enthroned between the cherubim, let the earth shake. 2 Great is the Lord in Zion; he is exalted over all the nations. 3 Let them praise your great and awesome name – he is holy. 4 The King is mighty, he loves justice – you have established equity; in Jacob you have done what is just and right.
