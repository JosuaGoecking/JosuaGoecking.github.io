    2Let him  smother me with kisses—his Spirit-kiss divine. So kind are your caresses, I drink them in like the sweetest wine! 3Your presence releases a fragrance so pleasing—over and over poured out.For your lovely name is “Flowing Oil.” No wonder the brides-to-be adore you. 4Draw me into your heart.We will run away together into the king’s cloud-filled chamber.
