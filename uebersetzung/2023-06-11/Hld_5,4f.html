    4My beloved reached into me to unlock my heart.The core of my very being trembled at his touch.How my soul melted when he spoke to me!5My spirit arose to open for more of his touch.As I surrendered to him, I began to sense his fragranceâ€”the fragrance of his suffering love!It was the sense of myrrh flowing all through me!
