    3My beloved is to methe most fragrant apple tree—he stands above the sons of men. Sitting under his grace-shadow,I blossom in his shade,enjoying the sweet taste of his pleasant, delicious fruit,resting with delight where his glory never fades.4Suddenly, he transported me into his house of wine—he looked upon me with his unrelenting love divine. 5Revive me with your raisin cakes. Refresh me again with your apples. Help me and hold me, for I am lovesick! I am longing for more—yet how could I take more?6His left hand  cradles my headwhile his right hand  holds me close.I am at rest in this love.
