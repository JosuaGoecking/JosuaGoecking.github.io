    â€‚4 You stand by those who joyfully do what is right, who follow your commandments and live with you. But you are angry with us, Lord, and rightly so: we have sinned and completely lost our way. 5 In your eyes we have all become unclean; even our good deeds are like filthy rags. Because of our sins, we are like withered leaves that fall to the ground and are blown away by the wind.
