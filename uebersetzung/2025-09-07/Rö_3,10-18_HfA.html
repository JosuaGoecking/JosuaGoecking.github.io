    10 The Scriptures say the same thing: "There is no one, not even one, who is without sin. 11 There is no one who is wise and seeks God. 12 All have turned away from him and have become useless to God. There is truly no one who does good, not even one. 13 Their words bring death and destruction.  All their speech is deceitful, and what comes from their lips is malicious and deadly like snake venom. 14 Their mouths are full of curses and hatred. 15 They are quick to shed blood. 16 They leave a trail of destruction and misery. 17 They do not know the way to peace, 18 for they have no reverence for God.
