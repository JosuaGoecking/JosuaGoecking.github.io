    20-21 May God, from whom all peace comes, help you to do good in every way and to fulfill his will. He raised our Lord Jesus Christ from the dead. He made him the true shepherd of his flock, through whose blood the new and eternal covenant was sealed. Jesus Christ will give you the strength to do what pleases God. To him be glory forever and ever. Amen.
