    18 “But forget all that—     it is nothing compared to what I am going to do. 19 For I am about to do something new.     See, I have already begun! Do you not see it? I will make a pathway through the wilderness.     I will create rivers in the dry wasteland. 20 The wild animals in the fields will thank me,     the jackals and owls, too,     for giving them water in the desert. Yes, I will make rivers in the dry wasteland     so my chosen people can be refreshed. 21 I have made Israel for myself,     and they will someday honor me before the whole world.
